# Project README

## Introduction
As part of my studies at ENSEIRB MATMECA, I undertook a VHDL project involving the implementation of a Snake game on an FPGA. This VHDL project, coupled with FPGA implementation, sparked my interest in processor architectures. Consequently, RISC-V processors emerged as a natural choice in my FPGA tinkering endeavors. I decided to dedicate my free time to a substantial project involving a RISC-V processor, with the following objectives:

1. Implement a reduced version of a RISC-V architecture on an FPGA using VHDL.
2. Develop an interface between the RISC-V processor and my PC for debugging and testing purposes (UART). The interface will be programmed in C and facilitate the reading and writing of registers.
3. Enable simple writing of instruction memory from my PC.
4. Establish a functional programming workflow (assembly programming).
5. Install and interface an RGB OLED screen on the FPGA with the RISC-V processor.
6. Program the game Snake in assembly language on the custom architecture!

These are the major milestones of the project, and they will not commence without an extensive period of documentation (FPGA, RISC-V, VHDL, etc.). 

## Documentation
My study of RISC-V primarily focuses on three resources:

1. "The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual, Volume I: User-Level ISA, Document Version 20191213" (ISM)
2. "Computer Organization and Design RISC-V edition" (COD)
3. "Guide to Computer Processor Architecture, A RISC-V Approach, with High-Level Synthesis, Bernard Goossens" (GCPA)
